## This project demonstrates how to securely configure an Amazon S3 bucket using IAM policies, encryption, and access restrictions, as part of a cloud security task for CodTech Internship.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

- **IAM User Setup:**  
  Created a user named `s3readonlyuser` with limited permissions using a custom IAM policy.

- **S3 Bucket Creation:**  
  A bucket named `production-level-bucket` was created with:
  - Public access **fully blocked**
  - **Bucket versioning** optionally enabled
  - **SSE-S3** (AES-256) server-side encryption enabled

- **Custom IAM Policy:**  
  Granted the IAM user only the `s3:ListBucket` permission to allow viewing the bucket, while **denying all object-level actions** (upload/download/delete).

- **Testing IAM User Access:**  
  - ‚úÖ Able to list all buckets.
  - ‚ùå Access denied for reading or modifying objects inside the bucket.
